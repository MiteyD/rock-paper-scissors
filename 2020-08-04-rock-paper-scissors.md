# Rock Paper Scissors

This project involved creating a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. 

A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time and hence the program I created needed to learn from the opponents' moves and counter their plays.

To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.

The datasets can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/rock-paper-scissors
