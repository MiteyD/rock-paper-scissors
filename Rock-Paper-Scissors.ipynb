    "# Rock Paper Scissors\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involved creating a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. \n",
    "\n",
    "A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time and hence the program I created needed to learn from the opponents' moves and counter their plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.\n",
